# Smart Pointers

Smart pointers are data structures that not only act like a pointer but also have additional metadata and capabilities.

Weâ€™ll cover the most common smart pointers in the standard library:

- `Box<T>` for allocating values on the heap
- `Rc<T>`, a reference counting type that enables multiple ownership
- `Ref<T>` and `RefMut<T>`, accessed through `RefCell<T>`, a type that enforces the borrowing rules at runtime instead of compile time.
