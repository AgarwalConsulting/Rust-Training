# Control Flow

## `if`

- Similar to `if ... else` in many other languages
- Can be used for assignment

## Repetition with loops

- Rust has three kinds of loops: `loop`, `while`, and `for`.

### `loop`

- You can `loop` forever in rust
- Control execution using `break` & `continue`
- Usually used as a retry mechanism
- Also useful for assignment as well

### `while`

- Normal

### `for`

- Can only be used as `for <el> in <iter>` format
